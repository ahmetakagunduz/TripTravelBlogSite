# TripTravelBlog
 Trip&Travel blog site project with asp.net mvc5

When the project is initially opened, it presents us with a homepage. The homepage consists of a basic header, a footer, a menu with five options (Home, About Us, Guide <not active>, My Blog, Contact), and content. The About Us page provides basic information about the project. The Guide section is not active. The My Blog section contains various holiday travel destinations, blog posts for these destinations, and comments. The Contact section contains personal information. There is also an Admin login for adjusting all blogs and comments.

The project primarily has the following functions:

CRUD operations for adding, deleting, and updating new blogs in the Admin section

CRUD operations for deleting and updating comments made by existing users in the Admin section

Ability to view blog posts and make comments in the UI section

Effective use of MVC (Model-View-Controller) layers

Efficient use of HttpGet and HttpPost attributes on the Controller side

Adoption of the CodeFirst principle and effective use of it on the Model side (tables and relationships synchronized with SQL Server Management Studio)

In summary, I have utilized various technologies to accomplish these functionalities.
